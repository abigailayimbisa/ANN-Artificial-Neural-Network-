# ANN-Artificial-Neural-Network Assignment

## Author: Ayimbisa Abigail

### Overview
This assignment involves using the iris dataset from RStudio to develop and compute Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). 
Three distinct models were created, each with a different number of hidden layers, to compare their performance and results.

### Analysis of Results

|                Model                | Accuracy |
|-------------------------------------|----------|
| Model with hidden layers c(6, 2)    | 100%     |
| Model with hidden layers c(15, 6, 4)| 93.33%   |
| Model with hidden layers c(50, 10)  | 100%     |

### Overfitting and Underfitting

**Underfitting:** 
Occurs when a network is too shallow, failing to capture the underlying trends in the data.
This results in poor performance on both training and validation datasets.
**Overfitting:** 
Happens when a network is too deep with too many hidden layers,
causing it to learn noise and specific details from the training set,
leading to poor generalization to new, unseen data.

This README provides an overview of the assignment and the comparative performance of the different ANN models.
